# `@yume-chan/adb-daemon-direct-sockets`

Use [Direct Sockets API](https://wicg.github.io/direct-sockets/) for plugin-free ADB over WiFi connection.

Note: Direct Sockets API is still under development. Currently it's only available in Chrome and requires extra command line arguments to enable. This package is not ready to be used in production, thus not published to NPM registry.
